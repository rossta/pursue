      notes: This Advanced 1 Marathon Training schedule is for experienced runners
        seeking to fine-tune their training by following a program that includes some
        speedwork plus more mileage than the programs followed by novice and intermediate
        runners. (The Advanced 2 program features two days of speedwork weekly.) Hopefully
        you arrived at this program with a background of speed training and know what
        it's like to do hill repeats, interval training on the track and tempo running
        in the woods. If not, this is no time to start. You would be much better following
        one of the Intermediate programs and saving this program for a later marathon.
        Okay, you read my disclaimer and agreed to the conditions for acceptance into
        this very tough program. For the next 18 weeks, you will use Monday as a day
        of comparative rest by running an easy 3-5 miles, then adjourning to the gym
        for 15-30 minutes of stretching and strength training. (This might be a good
        workout to do in a health club, since you can do your 3-miler on a treadmill
        before heading to the weight room.) Wednesday workouts will be about the same.
        Fridays are rest days, since even Advanced runners need to rest. Are you up
        to the challenge?

      notes: Hundreds of thousands of runners have run marathons using my training
        programs. Many have followed my Novice 1 program to finish their first marathon.
        Once having achieved that success, they often migrate upwards to use one of
        my intermediate or advanced programs, running more miles or adding speedwork
        to improve their times, to set Personal Records, even to qualify for the prestigious
        Boston Marathon, which accepts only runners who qualify by running fast times.
        Whether your goal is to qualify for Boston or not, welcome to my training
        program.

        continues, your Tuesday mileage will increase gradually from 5 miles in Week
        1 to 10 miles in Week 11. This is a sorta-long run, done midweek at longer
        distances than usual, but not as long as the weekend long runs. Feel free
        to punch the acceleration button if you're feeling good, particularly toward
        the end of the workout.

      notes: Marathons lend themselves to goal setting, because of the extra effort
        required both to train for them and to compete well in them, and simply because
        of the magic of the marathon itself. But setting a goal involves not merely
        selecting an event or events but also deciding what you expect from your participation
        in that event. Is your goal just to finish? Is your goal a PR? Is your goal
        victory, or at least placing high in your age group? Or maybe you are just
        out to have a good time?

      notes: Tuesday and Thursday workouts form a tough one-two punch in this Advanced
        1 schedule--but that's what it takes if you want to run a fast marathon, perhaps
        qualify for Boston, or go even faster! In between, you get to run easy. Jog
        an easy 3 miles today, then do some stretching, spending more time on this
        than you normally might do to ready yourself for tomorrow's speed session.
        You can also do some lifting today, but I don't recommend excessive strength
        training during the marathon buildup, and I suggest cutting back on what lifting
        you do as the marathon draws near. Most important, put together a regular
        routine that you can use each Monday and Wednesday.

      notes: How many miles a week are necessary to achieve peak performance in a
        maraton? My advanced marathon programs peak at about 50-60 miles a week. The
        exact number depends on how long you run warming up and cooling down. I've
        always stressed quality rather than quantity, but if you want to up your weekly
        miles, simply add a mile or two a day to your runs.

      notes: In this Advanced 1 program, Thursdays feature hill workouts, tempo runs
        and interval training on the track, alternating between each from week to
        week. I do this mainly to provide some variety to the program. Today the prescription
        is 3 x Hill. But the workout is slightly more complicated than that. Warm
        up with a couple of miles. Find a hill 200-400 meters long. Run 3 uphill repeats
        on it, jogging back down between. Cool down with a mile or two. That will
        give you a workout today of about 5 miles--but counting mileage is not important.
        More important is the quality of what you do, not the quantity. Even in the
        marathon, quality counts--at least for Advanced runners.

      notes: Marathons continue to grow in size. Chicago, New York and London all
        attract fields larger than 40,000 runners. Within the United States, according
        to figures from Running USA, the number of runners finishing marathons has
        grown from 170,000 to 400,000 in two decades. Those finishers are slightly
        older and somewhat slower, their motivation in entering a marathon (often
        their first road race of any distance) being mainly to finish it, not to finish
        it fast.

        countdown continues, you will be asked to rest. Notice I said rest, not cross-train
        or play a pickup basketball game or do something else that might get you injured.
        In this training schedule, the Saturday/Sunday combination will test your
        body''s reserves, so you need to be well rested going into the weekend. Some
        stretching and at least a minimum of strength training can be done today.
        By the way, in the novice schedules for this day, I libeled advanced runners
        saying that being compulsive, not all of you listen to my advice. So prove
        me a liar: Do listen!'

      notes: The preferred fuel for the endurance athlete is carbohydrates, because
        they are easy to digest and easy to convert into energy. Carbohydrates convert
        quickly into glucose (a form of sugar that circulates in the blood) and glycogen
        (the form of glucose stored in muscle tissue and the liver). Proteins and
        fats also convert into glucose/glycogen, but at a greater energy cost. The
        body can normally store about 2,000 calories worth of glycogen in the muscle,
        enough for maybe 20 miles of running.

        Pick a measured course where you can catch your time each mile. Measure the
        course yourself with a GPS watch or run on a track if necessary. Or enter
        a 10-K road race with the intention of ignoring the competition and running
        5 of its miles at what will seem like a slow (marathon) pace. I know: that''s
        not easy for an advanced runner to do. Visit the introductory screens here
        on TrainingPeaks or on halhigdon.com) for more directions on how to do Pace

      notes: 'Among those enrolled in the CARA Marathon Training Class in Chicago,
        the finishing rate is something like 99 percent. This is because they listen
        to me when I tell them to run their first marathon to have a good time rather
        than to run a fast time. This is one of the main themes of my lectures to
        first-timers. I suggest they pick a time goal a half hour slower than their
        potential, because it guarantees two things: 1) they will finish the race
        with a smile on their face, enjoying the experience, and 2) if they ever run
        a second marathon, they will be guaranteed to set a Personal Record because
        they ran so slowly the first time.'

      notes: Run long. Begin your progression at 10 miles. By gradually lengthening
        your mileage 1 mile a week, you can reach 20 miles eight weeks before the
        marathon and have time for three 20-milers, instead of one. Run 30 to 90 seconds
        or more per mile slower than marathon pace. In the advanced schedules, the
        long runs are on Sundays. If necessary, you can flip-flop your workouts and
        run long on Saturdays, but it's usually easier to go from fast to long than
        the other way around. If your work schedule dictates, you can do your long
        runs on any day of the week. In general, however, I would rather see you do
        pace work Saturdays followed by the long run on Sundays.

      notes: A large percentage of those entering at least the most popular marathons
        are running their first marathon, and it may turn into their only marathon.
        Forty percent of those who run Chicago each year are first-timers. Nevertheless,
        each one of those nouveaux marathoners will have chosen goals as carefully
        as have the elite at the front of the field.

      notes: Cruise an easy 3-miler. Don't run farther or harder thinking it will
        get you in better shape. More isn't always better. Evaluate how you felt after
        your first week of marathon training at the Advanced 1 level. Good? Okay?
        Awful? Hopefully you can handle the pressure of this demanding schedule. It's
        not going to get easier! A lot of people play at running, working out three
        or four days a week, doing a long run on the weekends, entering an occasional
        race, sometimes gearing up for a marathon. For a while, they'll improve just
        on accumulated mileage, but after several years it becomes increasingly difficult
        to set Personal Records. To do that, you need to train. And you need to train
        with a purpose. Training is when you follow a schedule, such as this one,
        where each day has a purpose. If the weather is bad, you still run. If you
        have important business, you simply rise an hour early to run. Why? Because
        I told you to! And if Hal tells you to run 3 miles today and afterwards do
        some strength training, please do it!

        Marathon, and she did so without a number, jumping into the race in Hopkinton
        after the approximately 500 male starters had passed. By 1975, female finishers
        at Boston represented 1.5 percent of the field (28 of 1,846 overall finishers).
        In the quarter century that followed, the marathon experienced many dramatic
        changes, none more dramatic than the emergence of women running 26 miles 385
        yards. By 2003, female finishers at Boston were more than 40 percent of the
        field.

        the middle to near 10-K race pace. A tempo run of 30 minutes would begin with
        10-15 minutes easy running, then building to peak speed for the next 10 minutes
        (15-25 minutes into the run), then finish with 5 minutes easy. In any tempo
        run, the pace buildup should be gradual, not sudden, with peak speed coming
        about two-thirds into the workout and only for a few minutes. You can do tempo
        runs almost anywhere: on the road, on trails or even on a track.'

      notes: Everybody knows that runners are supposed to eat pasta the night before
        the marathon to maximize glycogen storage in their muscles, but if you only
        pay attention to what you eat that one meal, you never will have success as
        a runner. You need to eat right before your long runs in training too. And
        every other day of the week too. Eating intelligently is a key to marathon
        success. If you make poor food choices, you compromise your ability to train
        hard—or even to train easy. You also miss the opportunity to train your intestinal
        tract to comfortably manage food and fluids while running.

      notes: Today is long-run day, and I'm asking you to go 11 miles, one mile further
        than the week before. One mistake you want to avoid is running these long
        runs too fast. Never do your long runs faster than marathon pace or even at
        marathon pace itself. That creates too much stress, coupled with your other
        training. Generally, I advise runners to do their long runs 30 to 90 seconds
        or more slower per-mile than race pace. This advice is even more important
        for advanced runners, because of the much harder training you are asked to
        do on other days of the week. You can't show up on a Thursday and expect to
        do speedwork at maximum effort if you ran to hard during your long runs.

      notes: It's a familiar joke among many marathoners that a frequent question
        they often get from their non-running friends is, How far is this marathon?
        The fact is that, technically speaking, all marathons are precisely 26 miles
        385 yards. Anything longer and the race is considered an ultramarathon. Anything
        less and the course either was mismeasured, or it's something else.

      notes: Continue with an easy 3-miler on Monday as part of your recovery from
        the hard weekend. If you want a full day's rest, this would be a good time
        to do it, since this is a stepback week with lesser distance for the Sunday
        long run. Most training programs are progressive, meaning you gradually increase
        mileage over a period of weeks and months. But we progress by moving up, then
        sliding backwards slightly before the next upward movement. It's a very effective
        way to train for a marathon, since it minimizes the risk of injury and overtraining
        that comes with never taking a rest.

      notes: The first event to be called a marathon was held in 1896 at the first
        modern Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. This long-distance footrace was staged
        at the end of those games to re-create and commemorate the legendary run of
        Pheidippides in 490 b.c. After the Greeks defeated the Persians in the Battle
        of Marathon, a town on the coast, Pheidippides ran to Athens with the news.
        Rejoice we conquer, he announced, then died.

      notes: For a dozen years after the first marathon in Athens, the official distance
        was approximately 25 miles. That was the distance run in the 1900 Olympic
        Games in Paris and the 1904 Games in St. Louis as well as in the Boston Marathon
        for its first 28 years. Then in 1908, in London, the British designed a marathon
        course that started at Windsor Castle and finished at the Olympic stadium,
        reportedly so the royal family could see the start of the race. The distance
        from start to finish for that marathon was 26 miles and 385 yards.

      notes: Three easy miles. And don't forget to do some stretching afterwards,
        since running this short distance today should leave you with plenty of extra
        time. While you should stretch before and after your speedwork, such as tomorrow,
        realistically, a lot of runners skip or short-change this important part of
        training, because of time factors. Remember that fast speedwork and long running
        will have the tendency to tighten your muscles. So stretching is particularly
        important in this Advanced program.

      notes: The running event that is so popular today might not be the same if the
        plains of Marathon had been closer to Athens. Exercise physiologists tell
        us that it is only after about two hours of running, or about 20 miles for
        an accomplished runner, that the body begins to fully deplete its stores of
        glycogen, the energy source that fuels the muscles. Once glycogen is depleted,
        the body must rely more on fat, a less efficient fuel source. This is one
        of the reasons runners hit the wall at 20 miles.

      notes: Speed day. We move to the track to run 4 x 800 meters. Jog or walk 2-3
        minutes between each repetition. Run each rep at about the pace you might
        run in a 5-K race. Or you might want to consider running these like Yasso
        Repeats, as mentioned in the introduction to the advanced programs on my Web
        site. Bart Yasso is Promotions Director for Runner's World. Bart suggests
        that you run your 800 repeats using the same numbers as your planned marathon
        time. In other words, if you want to run a 3-hour marathon, you do the 800s
        in 3 minutes. A 3:10 marathoner does 3:10 repeats; 3:20 marathoner, 3:20 repeats,
        etc. It seems silly, but it works. Try it and if it works for you, use it.
        If not, discard the idea.

        muscle memory. Establish your course (or courses) for these pace runs early
        in your training program. You need to know how fast you are going, so that
        when race day comes, you can fit right into your pacing groove. Your watch
        (or the clocks along the course) will be your guide on race day. Or if you're

      notes: Run 8 miles today at a comfortable pace. One difference between yesterday's
        6-miler and today's 8-miler (despite the slight difference in distance) is
        that today you run slower. I don't want you trying to run fast during your
        long runs. Most important is that you cover the distance and cover it with
        a reasonable level of comfort. There is a cumulative effect from all the miles
        you run in training that is often difficult to measure, but your fitness level
        should be increasing. As mentioned before, this is a stepback week where you
        drop down in distance. This is done every third week on long runs to offer
        you extra rest. Although today you run 8 miles, keep an invisible 12 in your
        mind, since we jump ahead to 13 miles next week.

      notes: In a marathon, except at the elite level, you do not beat others, as
        you might in a mile or a 100-meter dash. Instead, you achieve a personal victory.
        If others finish in front of or behind you, it is only that their personal
        victories are more or less than yours. A person finishing behind you with
        less talent, or of a different age or sex, or various other limiting factors,
        may have achieved a far greater victory. And if the person's main goal in
        running the marathon was to raise money for charity, the amount of money collected
        may be a more important barometer of success than finishing time.

        the long run on the weekend 13 miles. Four weeks out from the marathon (peak
        week before tapering begins), you will run about 52 miles for the week, 20
        on the weekend. Is that enough to insure success? I think so, but if you want
        more mileage you could consider adding a mile or two to some of your easy
        runs.

      notes: The marathon never ceases to be a race of joy, a race of wonder. Even
        when disaster strikes, when bad weather overwhelms you, when an intemperate
        pace results in a staggering finish, when nerves and anxiety stand in the
        way of giving your maximum effort, when your number one rival soundly thrashes
        you, when 18 weeks of training appear to have gone down the drain with little
        more than an ugly slurping sound, there remains something memorable about
        each marathon run.

      notes: The Tuesday sorta long run today is 6 miles. You're now into the first
        week of your second 3-week cycle and ready to resume the mileage buildup that
        is integral to successful marathon training. Subtle increases in distance
        (both daily and weekly) will pay off at the end of our 18-week program. If
        you're feeling good--and we hope you are after the stepback week--push the
        pace a bit today. Maybe for a mile or two toward the end of your run, increase
        your pace by about 15-30 seconds a mile. You still can converse, but you become
        more out-of-breath, and your training partner will say, Hey, what's your hurry?
        Smile and ease back. In terms of heart rate, you probably would be closer
        to 75 than 65 percent.

      notes: Most runners enjoy the training as much, or more, than the marathon itself.
        In a poll I took among participants in my forums, I discovered that more than
        three out of every four respondents liked training as much or more than the
        marathon. So if you are starting one of my 18-week training programs and fear
        that running all that mileage may become a grind, particularly if your longest
        run up to then has been two or three miles, relax and enjoy.

        to judge comfortable. If you are running with a partner, the two of you should
        be able to converse without getting significantly out of breath. Or, if you''re
        running alone, you could even talk to yourself--although people will think
        you''re crazy. If you train with a Heart Monitor, you would be running somewhere
        between 65 and 75 percent of your maximum heart rate. You should finish this
        workout feeling better than when you started. If you''re doing strength training,
        today is a good day for it. If you feel you need more mileage than I have
        prescribed, this is another day when you could add a few miles to the run.'

      notes: Running is a basic activity, instinctive to our being. People need not
        be taught how to run. Children learn to run almost as soon as they learn to
        walk. Visit any elementary school playground, and you will see kids sprinting
        all over the place. Children modify their behavior as they get older. Running
        starts to become a discipline rather than a natural form of exercise.

        a medical examination, including an exercise stress test. The American College
        of Sports Medicine recommends testing at age 40 for men and age 50 for women,
        if you are apparently healthy. But if you have any risk factor for coronary
        artery disease (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes or
        a family history of heart problems), you should be tested prior to vigorous
        exercise, at any age. If you have been overweight or recently were a smoker,
        your risks also are high.

      notes: This is the one day of the week when the workout never changes. It's
        rest. Take the day off. How can doing no running be considered a workout.
        I count it as such, because your day of rest is designed with a purpose. It's
        to get you ready for your weekend workouts, which generally are harder than
        weekday workouts. People who work 9-to-5 jobs--or have other obligations with
        children--often find it easier to find time to train over the weekend. Want
        to add more miles to your weekly total? Well, you could do some running today.
        A little bit One option that I often take the day before a race would be to
        jog a mile or two to a soft golf course, then run a half dozen strides near
        10-K pace, then finish with a mile or two. But rest may be the better option.

        a week. Other good sources of carbohydrate, according to Nancy Clark, RD,
        author of Nancy Clark''s Sports Nutrition Guidebook are: cereals, fruits,
        juices, breads, rice, plain baked potatoes, peas, corn, fruit, yogurt and
        frozen yogurt. But not ice cream, cheesy lasagna and pepperoni pizza. Those
        foods often get confused with carbohydrates, but actually contribute more
        fat than needed to your diet. Carbo-loading should begin months before the
        race, not the night before she advises.'

      notes: Run 6 miles at marathon race pace, the same distance as last week. This
        is the third Saturday pace workout in the first four weeks of your program.
        Please be alert to the fact that I sometimes say Pace and I sometimes say
        Run. The former means marathon pace; the latter means run at any pace that
        feels comfortable that day. Should each mile be run precisely at race pace?
        If you're planning 8:00 miles, should each of the 6 miles done today be done
        exactly in 8:00? Not necessarily, but you should be close both in training
        and in the marathon itself. External factors may cause variations. Your first
        mile, for instance, might be somewhat slower since you aren't fully warmed
        up. Your last mile also might also be slower, since you're starting your cooldown--or
        faster because you feel inspired and want to kick the last quarter. If there's
        a wind shift because you turn around, tailwinds or headwinds may cause you
        to go faster or slower. An uphill in one mile may slow you; a downhill in
        another may speed you up. This will be true in the marathon itself. These
        Saturday workouts are all about learning pace, not necessarily hitting each
        mile split right on the head.

      notes: Almost all training designed to improve runners is based on moving from
        level to level. You work harder and improve, moving from a low level to a
        higher level. This is your body's progressive adaptation to increasing stress.
        This 18-week program features increases of approximately one mile a week for
        the weekend long runs. Over that time period, weekly mileage doubles.

      notes: We're back into the mileage progression. Run 13 miles today. Your total
        mileage for the week should be about 35 miles, or about three times the length
        of your longest run. As the length of your long run increases, your total
        weekly mileage also will increase--but we don't want you to overtrain and
        run too much. This is not a mega-mileage training program! A runner from Argentina
        recently posted a question to one of the V-Boards in Virtual Training. He
        was running 50 miles a week going into the 18-week program and wanted to drop
        his time from 3:20 to 3:10. He felt the early mileage of the Advanced program
        might be too low for him, and wondered where he might add miles. Well, as
        I've indicated above, he could add 2-3 miles to his easy runs on Mondays and
        Wednesdays, and he could warm up a few miles more before fast runs on Thursdays.
        He could even run instead of rest on Fridays. Would this allow the runner
        from Argentina to run a faster marathon? Maybe, but it also raises the risk
        that he might fail because of injury or overtraining. Sometimes runners seeking
        to improve should be ready to assume some risk; other times, they should not.

        I can't offer you a number. There is no physiological basis for saying how
        much you can increase your workload. Runners differ enormously in both their
        capability and their capacity. Some people with little training background
        have tremendous potential for improvement.

      notes: Run an easy 3 miles today at your usual comfortable pace. If you haven't
        already done so, now is the time to evaluate your equipment, beginning with
        your footwear. Consider your running shoes. Are they worn? Are they comfortable?
        Will they carry you through 26 miles 385 yards? It may be time to purchase
        a new pair--in fact several pair so you can alternate shoes from day to day.
        This allows them to dry out and rebound, meaning that hopefully they will
        offer more protection. Begin also to think about what pair of shoes you will
        wear on race day--although you may not want to buy them yet. There are pluses
        and minuses to wearing lightweight racing shoes. Lighter can mean faster,
        but not if you sacrifice cushioning and protection.

        Have a wedding scheduled one weekend? They ask my permission to do the long
        run the weekend before or the weekend after. One runner from Salt Lake City
        even wondered if he could do his Saturday long runs on Mondays when he had
        the day off. Sure, I said. And it is okay to flip-flop workouts and weeks
        just as long as you do not lose too many pieces from the puzzle. Is this anal

        let your mind drift. Focus on form and relaxation and visualize how you will
        feel in the middle of the marathon running this same pace. Succeeding in a
        race as long as 26 miles 385 yards often depends on training the mind as well
        as the body. Keeping the theme of running equipment begun on Monday, while
        shoes are the most important item of equipment a runner can own, comfortable
        clothing also is a must. What will you wear on race day?

      notes: A beginning runner who has just finished a first marathon will continue
        to improve if he or she does nothing else but train consistently. Most established
        training programs for first-time marathoners last three months or more. Class
        leaders guide their students through a graduated schedule, the main feature
        being a long run that gets progressively longer (usually from 6 to 20 miles)
        as marathon day approaches. Students are usually sent to the starting line
        undertrained and well rested, because experience has shown that to be the
        best way to ensure that they finish. Better to be safe than sorry.

        months and even years, so such pinnacle workouts can be handled without excess
        strain. In all training matters, it is consistency that counts. After you've
        run a few marathons and want to up the length of your longest runs, then you're
        experienced enough to make that choice yourself.

      notes: This is your day of rest, a very important component of your weekly training.
        By now, maybe it also has begun to sink in that you don't want to stay out
        too late either Friday or Saturday evenings if you have a hard or long workout
        scheduled for the next day. Today being a rest day, maybe this is a day to
        head to that running store to purchase some of the items of clothing discussed
        earlier in the week. And make sure it is a running store. While you might
        be able to find better bargains at chain stores in the mall, it's better to
        shop in a specialty store owned by runners who understand our sport.

      notes: One purpose of the long runs is not merely to get your legs in shape,
        but also to get the systems around those legs in shape. A critical item for
        running success is learning to drink on the run, finding the proper combination
        of water and replacement drink that works best for you. And if your marathon
        of choice has a specific replacement drink, you better practice drinking that
        too. You do not want to get to the first aid station only to discover you
        do not like the taste.

      notes: There is also no exact formula for how much of what to drink, since that
        depends not only on an individual runner's preferences, but also on weather
        conditions.

      notes: Seven miles for today's workout, the same as Tuesday. You're gradually
        increasing your miles on this other run of the weekend. The Saturday/Sunday
        runs will work in combination to get you in shape. Since this is not a pace
        workout, you don't have to worry as much about running on a precisely measured
        course. There are times in your marathon training when you need to be precise
        about what you do; this is not one of those times. The two most important
        factors for improvement, claims Coach Jack Daniels, are consistency and moderation.
        Consistency means identifying long-range goals to work toward while achieving
        short-range goals. If you allow enough time for your long-range goals, you
        can employ moderation. You won't need to overtrain.

      notes: Mileage buildups of the magnitude required to finish a marathon create
        stress. A certain amount of stress is acceptable and good, since stress creates
        strength. Too much stress, however, is bad. Many runners have conditioned
        themselves mentally and physically to run every day with few days off to rest.
        This may be all right if you run easy, training for health and enjoyment with
        an occasional 5-K thrown in for spice. If you are peaking for a marathon,
        however, failure to take rest days is a ticket to injury.

      notes: Risk? Are you willing to take it? Usually I tell runners to train using
        a program that they easily can handle. For first-timers, I would like all
        of them to choose Novice 1 and Novice 2. But after runners have a half dozen
        or more marathons into their logs, yes, you can accept some risk, training
        harder, coming close to the red line of self-destruction. And that may happen.

      notes: 'We''re now up to 14 miles on our long run. This is more than half the
        distance that you will cover in the marathon itself. Fourteen miles is the
        peak run in the second 3-week segment of your training. You''re probably still
        feeling frisky, so don''t make the too common mistake of doing your long runs
        at marathon race pace, thinking more is better. It''s not, and it can get
        you in trouble as marathon day approaches. Run at a pace 30-90 seconds or
        more per mile slower than race pace. Does this workout seem too easy for you
        in your advanced state of condition? I''ll give you permission to convert
        this into a 3/1 workout. That is: run the first 3/4 of the workout at your
        normal, hopefully comfortable, long-run pace mentioned above. Then over the
        final 1/4 of the distance, pick up the pace by about 15-30 seconds--not all
        the way to marathon pace, but somewhat close. How does it feel? If you can
        finish these long runs feeling and looking good, it will be a big boost to
        your confidence. That is one reason to run the early part of the workout somewhat
        slower and in control. You will need this ability to control your pace when
        you go 26-385 on race day. So finish strong, knowing that next week is another
        stepback week.'

      notes: Research by Edward F. Coyle, Ph.D., at the University of Texas at Austin,
        suggests that runners begin to detrain (lose their fitness) after 48 to 72
        hours, and that it takes two days of retraining to regain the fitness lost
        for every single day of training that is skipped. That does not mean you should
        never rest, but if you take long periods off, it will take you longer to come
        back. That is why consistency is so critical to marathon success. You do not
        need to maintain continuous peak condition, but settle on a consistent level
        of training that you know you can maintain for 12 months of the year. When
        it comes time to aim for a specific marathon, you can increase your level
        of training slightly.

      notes: Seven miles for your Tuesday sorta-long run. How do you feel after the
        first six weeks of your marathon buildup? The answer to that question will
        partly dictate how hard you run today. Most runners probably would fare best
        running their harder workouts later in the day, when they are not stiff following
        a night's sleep, but work and family obligations dictate when to run. Do whatever
        works best for you, and don't be afraid to modify my schedules to suit your
        own purpose. As you continue, if you feel you've bitten off more than you
        can chew with this program, you can always slide back into an intermediate
        program with honor. It's better to be safe than sorry.

        and I find 3 miles a comfortable distance for recovery workouts. In Florida,
        where I now have a second home, I run from a club near the Atlantic Ocean
        to a second club: 1.5 miles down the beach. Often I run barefoot at low tide
        on this perfect running beach, splashing along the water''s edge, dodging
        jellyfish marooned on the sand. I walk a minute or two, then run back. Usually,
        I find myself running faster on the return journey than going out. That should

      notes: At peak training, most top runners average 100 miles or more a week.
        You cannot compete successfully as an elite runner in the marathon, or even
        as a near-elite, unless you run a lot of miles. Most runners would crash if
        they attempted to run 100 miles weekly, even half that many miles. Determining
        the level that is best for you is tricky and may take several years of experimentation,
        but once you have reached a comfortable level, you can reap the benefits of
        success.

        5-K pace. If you decided to try Yasso Repeats, check the introduction to the
        advanced schedules on my Web site for a reminder as to how this works. You
        can do this same 5 x 800 workout on the road or even on trails. If you don't
        have exact measurements, run for time instead of distance. For example, if
        you normally run 6:00 mile pace in a 5-K, an equivalent workout would be 5
        x 3 minutes.

        pace. Unfortunately, most novice runners do not know their marathon pace,
        because they never have tested it in a marathon, and many have not run races
        at shorter distances. But I assume this is not your first long distance race

        it's not easy to know what race distances are available for runners in different
        areas of the country. But this might be a good weekend to do a test 10-K race,
        or even a 15-K or 10-miler. It depends on what the local schedule has to offer.
        Run a mile or two to warm up and cool down by jogging a mile or so. Various
        charts and formulas allow you to use your 10-K time to predict your marathon
        time. One such formula is to multiply your 10-K time by the number 4.66. More

      notes: It's dangerous to race too often during the marathon buildup period.
        Once every third or fourth week seems to be the limit. More often and you
        risk tearing yourself down rather than building yourself up. Prudence also
        suggests cutting back overall mileage and skipping the long run during weeks
        that include a test race. I usually advise runners who want to run a specific
        race to schedule it at the end of a stepback week, even though they may need
        to juggle weeks in their planned schedule to do so.

      notes: Three miles at an easy pace. These easy rest days might offer a good
        time to do some extra stretching, particularly after Sunday's long run. Also,
        don't be afraid to program in an extra day of rest--any day of the week--if
        you feel your body needs it. Don't be a slave to any training schedule, this
        one or any other. Having said that, if you take too many days off you will
        compromise your training program. Balance is essential in any program for
        success. You don't want to do too much; you don't want to do too little.

      notes: When you analyze the training of fast runners, you discover that not
        only do they train at slow paces, but that they train differently each day.
        If I had to cite one mistake made by inexperienced marathoners when they seek
        to improve their performance, it is that they run too many of their miles
        at the same pace, and over the same distance.

      notes: 'It varies from runner to runner, depending on size and metabolism, but
        most of us burn 100 calories for every mile we run. Burn 3,600 calories by
        running 36 miles and you lose one pound. But it does not matter how fast you
        run those miles. You can even walk and burn near the same number of calories
        per mile. Scientists quibble over the precise numbers, but calorie loss is
        related to foot-pounds: the amount of effort (that is, energy) it takes to
        push a body of a specific weight forward. You can run a 5:00 mile or a 10:00
        mile, and you willl still burn approximately 100 calories for covering the
        identical distance.'

      notes: 'Four miles at a comfortable pace. Yes, that''s one mile further for
        this day than I have asked you to run during the first six weeks of my marathon
        training program. It''s all part of a gradual buildup to more mileage. Gradual
        is the operative word in the previous sentence. Other than more mileage, another
        reason I schedule changes in distance is for variety, so you won''t be running
        the same distances day after day after week after week. Since experienced
        runners such as you often have set courses for different distances, this may
        even force you to select another route for your run: Course A vs. Course B.
        It''s a mind thing. The difference between doing 3 and 4 miles may also result
        in an almost imperceptible pace change, which is also good. Plus, you burn
        an extra 100 calories. Remember: The pace should remain easy.'

        You can grab more fluids and drink more easily while walking. 2) Walk if you
        cannot run any further, although it is best to walk before you are forced
        to. 3) Do some walking in training, if only to learn how to start running
        again after being brought to a halt. 4) Take walking breaks in training and

      notes: Massages can be expensive, but when you decide to train for a marathon
        you make a major time commitment and also a financial commitment given the
        cost of entry fees, not to mention the cost of travel if you pick a marathon
        not in your home town. Given that commitment, you might as well do right everything
        connected with the marathon. Schedule a massage for 48 hours after your long
        run, since that is often the peak point of muscle soreness. The massage will
        help you ease your way back into your regular routine. More frequent massages
        during the final six weeks leading up to your peak long run may help reduce
        the risk of injury by keeping you loose and relaxed.

      notes: An important part of every marathoner's training is rest. Running a short
        distance at a slow period would qualify as rest. A day where you cross-trained
        by swimming or cycling also might qualify as rest. But sometimes active rest
        is not enough; you need to take a day off when you do not run, or do much
        of anything. Although I promote consistency as critical to success, there
        are times when you simply have to kick back and do nothing. And I mean nothing!
        Take a week off. Take a couple of weeks off. Yes, you will lose some fitness,
        but you will more than make up for it if you return to training refreshed
        and ready to run hard again.

      notes: Exercise physiologists say that when you run slowly, your body has time
        to metabolize fat as a source of energy. When you run fast your body burns
        glycogen, a derivative of carbohydrate, as its preferred energy source. Glycogen
        is stored in the muscles and is a more efficient fuel in the sense that the
        body can metabolize it more rapidly than fat. But by training slowly, you
        teach your muscles to become more efficient at also metabolizing fat, thus
        sparing glycogen stores for those last few miles in the marathon.

      notes: Recovery is the order of the day, so 3 miles of easy running. Stop in
        the middle of the workout to stretch for 5 minutes or so. Or save some time
        for stretching at the end, followed by strength training. This is your eighth
        week of training in my 18-week marathon training program. You may get a bit
        bored running the same, or near-same, distances day after day, week after
        week after week. There are a lot of short runs of 3 to 5 miles in this program,
        and I suspect a lot of runners will run the same courses with minor variations.
        If it's an out-and-back course, your options are limited, but if it's a so-called
        loop course that goes in a circle, running it in the opposite direction will
        result in a needed change of scenery. Use the opportunity to do something
        different, when it suits your purpose, and don't be afraid to jump in a car
        occasionally and pick some scenic route you never run as a mood booster.

        is nothing speedy about the pace at which they run 26-mile races. If that
        is so, why do speedwork, with its ultimate threat of injury? First-time marathoners
        need give little attention to speedwork: Their main goal is to gradually (but
        gently) increase their mileage so that they can finish a 26-mile race. Improving
        marathoners probably should also focus their attention on determining what
        level of high-mileage training works best for them. But after you have been
        running for several years and you begin to shave seconds instead of minutes
        off your PRs, or if you start to slip backward, it is time to turn to speedwork.'

      notes: Eight miles. Did you handle this distance pretty well last week? If so,
        you might want to run a nudge faster this day. Don't push too hard at the
        start, but see if you can pick up the pace the last mile or two. The fact
        that you're moving at a slightly faster pace over a slightly longer distance
        doesn't mean you can't hold a conversation with a partner while running, but
        allow yourself the luxury of getting slightly out of breath. Important to
        success in any sport is a distance base, and that is one of the purposes for
        running a bit longer today. Melvin H. Williams, Ph.D., an exercise physiologist
        at Old Dominion University and a top-ranked masters athlete, was never a distance
        runner in high school, but he ran to get in shape for other sports. All of
        that background running helped to lay a groundwork of base training that he
        took advantage of immediately when he got serious about being a runner, says
        Dr. Williams.

        form is by running fast in practice. If you can learn to run more economically,
        you will perform better at all distances and levels. I am not sure why speed
        training improves your running form. Maybe you recruit different muscles.
        Maybe you force yourself to move more smoothly. Maybe by learning how to run
        at speeds faster than race pace, you are more relaxed when you do run that
        pace in a marathon. Maybe it is all of these reasons.

      notes: Four miles at a comfortable pace. On these midweek workouts, run at a
        time convenient for you, a time when you will feel comfortable running. The
        majority of runners run in the morning, because that guarantees that nothing
        will interfere with their workout that day. Also, during warm-weather months,
        it is cooler during the early hours. Nevertheless, a fair number of runners
        run during their lunch hour. During the winter up north, I usually run midday
        because the sun is up, and it's usually somewhat warmer. A certain percentage
        prefer running late afternoon, using running to relax after a stressful business
        day. And a few run in the late evening after dinner. In families where both
        the husband and wife run, they often need to run separately, rather than together,
        so one of them can mind the kids. Not only pick the time that is most convenient
        for you, think of others around you. There's also nothing that says you can't
        run at different times on different days depending on your schedule.

      notes: Speed is of limited importance during long runs; more important is time
        spent on your feet. One long run strategy for runners following time-based
        programs is to set as goal for the longest run approximately the length of
        time they plan to run in the marathon itself, not worrying about the distance
        or the speed at which they cover the distance.

      notes: Your Tempo Run today is 40 minutes, five minutes longer than when you
        last did this workout three weeks ago. For a variation, build to a speed peak
        about 25 minutes into the run, back off slightly for a few minutes and build
        to another peak. Sort of like riding a roller-coaster. This should not be
        a killer workout, but concentrate on how you're running, your form--particularly
        during the fast part of the run. Associating (paying attention to what you're
        doing) can help you run faster than dissociating (letting your mind wander).
        In research at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, Hein Helgo Schomer,
        Ph.D. had coaches accompany a group of mid-pack runners during workouts, pedaling
        beside them on a bicycle. The coaches reinforced associative thoughts, commented
        Dr. Schomer, praising the runners and reminding them to monitor body signals.
        Before coaching, the runners used association only 45 percent of the time.
        By the fifth week, they were associating 70 percent of the time, and their
        average training intensity also rose. Runners later commented that the mental-strategy
        training program inspired them to run harder workouts.

      notes: One of the skills that separates the good runners from the almost-good
        runners is an ability to focus their attention for the entire period of the
        race, whether it is a mile or a marathon. Dissociating is a good strategy
        for beginning marathoners, but not for people who want to run fast. When your
        mind wanders during a marathon, inevitably you slow down. If you stay focused,
        you learn how to concentrate all body systems to sustain a steady pace, conserve
        your energy and maintain your running form.

      notes: Preparing for the weekend's double-pronged endurance activities, claim
        a day of rest. Friday is Date Night in the Higdon household. Rose and I usually
        like to go out for dinner and maybe take in a movie, or rent a video. Assuming
        you're going out for dinner tonight, do you pay attention to your diet? Frequently,
        when people become runners, they find that they begin to eat differently.
        This is partly conscious and partly subconscious and reflects the fact that
        carbohydrates are the most efficient form of energy. People who embrace fitness
        routines discover this through their reading, but often it happens naturally.
        Runners crave carbs; their bodies tell them that breads and grains and fruits
        and vegetables are the best foods for fitness and for good health. You'll
        often find us in an Italian restaurant the night before long workouts or marathons.
        I'm lucky in that I don't have to eat out to get spaghetti; Rose is of Italian-American
        descent.

      notes: Knowing when to back off and take a complete day off, or even more, is
        one of the secrets of marathon success. It is not easy, since the traditional
        work ethic that has proved successful for many people suggests that more is
        better. The training diary we all keep would be more of a hindrance than a
        help if it pushed us to run extra miles just to achieve mileage levels we
        may have planned months ago without considering whether I have a cold, or
        failed to get enough sleep the night before, or am overly fatigued because
        of having spent most of the previous day on an airplane.

        Yes, I'm letting up a bit on you; that's because there's another mileage jump
        (to 17) tomorrow. Although it's fun to train with other runners, unless you're
        training with a friend who plans to run with you on marathon day, you might
        be better off running this workout alone. That's because it's too easy during
        a group workout to rely on others for pace cues. You need to develop the strength
        to go at your own pace, even while others around you are speeding up or slowing
        down. The type of discipline that permits you to do this will come in handy
        on race day.

      notes: Speedwork usually involves bursts of fast running (at race pace) followed
        by periods of slower running, or rest. That is essential, because most runners
        probably can achieve race pace for long distances only when well motivated
        and rested, in other words, during the race itself. To achieve race pace in
        practice, they need to cut their race distance into segments, and rest between
        those segments. If you were a competitor at 5000 meters, you could run 12
        x 400 meters in a workout, resting short periods after each 400, and simulate
        some of the stress of your race as well as practicing race pace.

        miles at your normal pace. How is your running form? Usually I tell runners
        not to worry about form; just get out and run. But once runners seek to run
        fast, how they move is worth some consideration. For the rest of the week,
        I'm going to sneak some tips on running form into the daily instructions.
        As you run 3 miles today, consider your posture. You should run upright. Your
        back should be straight, roughly at a 90-degree angle to the ground. Ignore
        anyone who tells you to lean into it, even when running uphill.

      notes: Even though so-called experts warn that speedwork can increase your risk
        of injury (not always true), most runners seeking improved performance do
        head to the track now and then. While researching the book Masters Running,
        I surveyed more than 500 older runners and, to my surprise, discovered 71
        percent included at least some speedwork in their training. And in a later
        survey on my InterActive bulletin boards, I discovered an even higher percentage
        (87.5) confessed to being speed freaks.

        Assess how you feel. If you're still fatigued from Sunday's 17-miler, you
        may want to float this workout to allow for better recovery. If you're feeling
        frisky, don't be afraid to push the pace a bit, particularly in the middle
        of the run. Here's another tip on form related to head carry that you can
        consider while running today. Look straight down the road. Your eyes should
        be focused on a point moving about 10 meters in front of you. Try to run in
        a straight line and not wander back and forth.

      notes: For runners seeking peak performance, whether in the marathon or in some
        other event, the ideal is to determine within a tenth of a mile, if possible,
        the weekly mileage at which your body self-destructs. Then you can train to
        the edge of disaster, occasionally pushing over that edge to determine whether
        months and years of steady training (or a new pair of shoes) have allowed
        you to nudge your breaking point to a new level.

      notes: Four miles at your normal pace. Still need some relax time? Take it!
        A day off now and then won't hurt. Writing training schedules that will be
        used by tens of thousands of runners with varying levels of ability, it's
        hard for me to judge how any one runner will feel on any one day. You have
        to determine how hard or easy to train. When in doubt, be cautious. Continuing
        the discussion on running form, swing your arms naturally. The angle at the
        elbow between your upper and lower arms should be about 90 degrees. Your hands
        should be loosely cupped, about belly level. Let your arms swing in rhythm
        with your legs. The legs should control arm swing, not the other way around.
        Form is also important not only in strength training exercises, but it is
        also important when you stretch. Don't be sloppy in anything you do connected
        with your running.

        your legs feel dead most of the time, your workout and race times have started
        to deteriorate, and you enjoy running less and less. By overdoing it, you
        may be predisposing yourself to injury. If you overtrain, something bad will
        happen: not can happen, will happen. Marathon runners probably are more prone
        to overtraining than other runners, simply because of the volume of training
        required. It stands to reason that if you train more, you increase your chances

        efficiency and mental focus. When I say efficiency, that means your ability
        to expend less energy at a specific pace than if you were a less efficient

        running often forces people to change their lifestyles. Last week, we talked
        briefly about the fact that runners usually modify their diets, eating more
        carbohydrates than they might have before. Typically, they change their drinking
        habits too, realizing that moderation is the key. Rarely do I see runners
        drinking alcoholic beverages other than wine or beer--and usually not much
        of that. That's because when you start to run, you quickly realize that it's
        no fun to run with a hangover. Thus does running create positive habits for
        those who pursue it.

        foot landing first, the heel contacting the ground a fraction of a second
        later. The toes push off a fraction after that. Some runners land further
        forward, or backward, than others, based on what feels natural to them.

        those muscles' ability to remove and utilize available oxygen. In addition,
        long runs recruit muscle fibers that would otherwise go unused. This recruitment
        insures a greater pool of conditioned fibers that may be called upon during
        the later stages of the race.

      notes: Half way home. You have nine weeks of marathon training behind you and
        nine more to go. After a stepback week, this is the beginning of another three-week
        cycle. I have long runs of 19 and 20 miles planned for you over the next two
        weekends. Your weekly mileage will also increase to near 50 miles during this
        next cycle. As you run 3 miles today, contemplate the training behind and
        the training ahead.

      notes: It is important to cut your training during a cold and cease it entirely
        if you have the flu (with elevated temperature), because you may increase
        your chance of an injury while in a weakened condition. You can run a marathon
        with a cold without it greatly affecting performance (dehydration may be your
        worst problem), but running a marathon with the flu is definitely unwise.
        You may finish, but you can significantly compromise your immune system, and
        incur health problems that can extend not merely weeks, but months and even
        years.

      notes: I believe in undertraining runners, rather than overtraining them. The
        upper limit for my advanced marathon training programs falls somewhat below
        60 weekly miles. I do not tell runners not to run more miles weekly; I simply
        believe they better know what they are doing before pursuing a more aggressive
        program. Those who regularly run 60 miles a week and whose systems have adapted
        to that high load, may not be at increased risk. Instead of being overtrained,
        they may be well trained.

      notes: Four easy miles. Make this an easier workout than usual. While I sometimes
        suggest that runners move a bit faster on some of the easy days, today is
        not one of those days. Consider the fact that in addition to the sorta long
        run yesterday and the speed training tomorrow, you have a 9-miler at marathon
        pace Saturday followed by a 19-miler on Sunday. That's a lot of running. By
        running easy today and resting Friday, you are loading the gun so you are
        assured of running well on the weekend.

      notes: 'Hill training. Add one more repetition from three weeks ago: 6 x Hill.
        And maybe it''s time to add some additional mileage before and/or after. If
        you''ve warmed up with 2 miles, consider going 2.5 or 3. Subtle changes in
        mileage distances work better than quick jumps, which can cause injuries,
        or extra fatigue. And don''t forget to stretch. Mid-workout works best. Research
        shows that warm tissues stretch better than cold tissues. Many runners interpret
        this to mean that you jog 5-10 minutes before stopping to stretch. Robert
        Forster, however, offers another opinion. Nobody said you can''t stretch cold
        muscles, says the California physiotherapist, who included Jackie Joyner-Kersee
        among his clients. When people are prone to injuries--or if they''ve been
        sitting down all day--they need to stretch before exercise as well. Forster
        recommends that runners develop a routine that begins with some simple pre-workout
        stretches, then continues after a short jog warms the muscles. Stretching
        after the workout also is a good time to increase flexibility. There is no
        best time to stretch, he concludes. You need to continually work on your flexibility
        to achieve success as a runner.'

      notes: Making the switch from treadmill to pavement in spring sometimes can
        be tricky. There is a subtle, but important difference, between running on
        a moving belt, which can carry you along, and running on pavement, when all
        of the propulsion is yours. Runners who trust the numbers related to pace
        on their treadmills are sometimes surprised to find that they have to work
        harder to maintain that pace outdoors. Nevertheless, treadmills generally
        provide a more cushioned running surface than the roads around the fitness
        center.

        weeks. You may not have discovered muscles you didn't know you had. But you
        should begin to notice some improvements in your fitness level and, hopefully,
        some improvement in your overall ability to run fast. This training program

      notes: Nine miles at race pace. Add this to tomorrow's long run, and it adds
        up to more miles than you'll run in the marathon. Is there a local 10-K that
        you could run today as part of your workout (using the warm-up and cool-down
        to get the extra few miles)? Run it only if you have the discipline to run
        under control, even though you know you could run faster. This control will
        be essential on race day. Anybody can run the first 6-9 miles of a marathon
        at a fast pace. The secret is to run the last 6-9 miles of the marathon at
        that same fast pace. Control and discipline are the essentials of marathon
        success.

      notes: One of the main causes of running injuries is the stress caused by the
        literally thousands of times your feet hit the ground when you run. If you
        have ever seen any slow-motion photography of what happens to the leg muscles
        during a single running stride, you would wonder how we survive even a single
        lap on a track, much less a marathon. Swimming, skiing, cycling, and walking
        do not generate this ground impact.

        Now you are learning the discipline you need for running 26 miles 385 yards.
        During this Advanced 1 training program, I''ll ask you to run five long runs
        at 17 and beyond. (These longest long runs come in Weeks 8, 10, 11, 13 and
        15.) They are very, very important. By now, you should have begun to adapt
        to the rhythm of these long runs. Don''t do them too fast. Take walking breaks
        if necessary. Drink plenty of water. If you can''t find water fountains along
        your route, consider purchasing a belt for carrying fluids. Yes, you have

        That is the longest run I suggest to runners using my training programs, even
        advanced runners. But in countries outside the United States, 30 kilometers
        (18.6 miles) is equally round and is as frequently used. Most coaches feel
        that once you reach 16-17 miles, you are in long-run territory.

      notes: One way to diminish road shock is to wear properly cushioned shoes. Running
        shoe companies spend millions of dollars on research and technology to design
        shoes that help prevent injuries. Various energy-absorbing materials, and
        air built into or pumped into your shoes, can decrease the impact of running
        on either asphalt or concrete. One possible reason that male marathon times
        have improved by nearly 20 minutes in the last half century may be better
        footwear, and, as a result, fewer training injuries.

        45 minutes seems to me the optimum distance. Run much longer than 45 minutes
        (5 or 6 miles of running for most runners) and the quality of the workout
        begins to suffer because of the sheer quantity of the miles run. The Kenyans
        achieve success by doing hard tempo runs for an hour or more, but most runners
        would break down if faced with this level of stress.

      notes: Stretching and strengthening can minimize injury. The best time to stretch
        a muscle is after it is warmed up. Track runners typically jog a mile or two,
        then stretch or do calisthenic exercises before beginning the intense part
        of their workout. Long-distance runners are less likely to pause in the middle
        of a long run to stretch, although this practice is becoming more common.
        I will stretch before long runs and in the middle of intense workouts, but
        my preferred time to stretch is after the workout, usually while relaxing
        in a whirlpool, even though some experts advise against this approach, saying
        it is too easy to overstretch when the hot water dims your senses.

      notes: You'll need today's rest, given what's planned for the weekend. If tonight
        is Date Night and you go out for dinner, pick from the menu well. A well-balanced
        diet for runners is to obtain 55 percent of calories from carbohydrates, 30
        percent from fats and 15 percent from proteins. Complex carbohydrates found
        in pasta, rice and fruit are the best. It's one reason why runners often wind
        up in Italian restaurants on Friday nights. Forget fad low-carbohydrate diets
        that some people use for losing weight. They don't work for endurance athletes.

      notes: Typically, I schedule a massage once every two weeks, more frequently
        if I am training hard for a specific race. And I will often schedule a massage
        for a day or two before or after the race, particularly if it is a marathon.
        I have also found that a massage is the perfect antidote to jet lag, although
        it sometimes requires skill to locate a massage therapist in a different city
        or country. Before arriving in Australia for the 2001 World Masters Championships,
        I scheduled a massage with a therapist in Sydney the day after I arrived.

        bouts may do too much because they are using different (read unfatigued) muscle
        groups. If you are not careful, you can convert an easy day into a hard day,
        and it will eventually catch up with you.

      notes: The Big 20--and it comes at the end of a high-mileage week. I've emphasized
        on previous screens that I would rather have you do the long runs slow rather
        than fast. Here's one reason. Part of your training is to become used to being
        on your feet near the same length of time as in the marathon. So slow down
        and take your time. The purpose of today's workout is to train yourself psychologically
        as much as physically. You have to know how and when to hold back in the early
        miles. If this means, doing more walking mid-workout while taking fluids,
        do it.

      notes: Nearly every training program gradually builds runners up to about 20
        miles, rests them two to four weeks, then sends them off to the starting line
        with a pat on the fanny. And it works! Most runners who follow my marathon
        training schedules jump from 20 miles in practice to 26 in the race fairly
        easily. The excitement of the event coupled with several weeks rest during
        the taper period helps them bridge the gap. First timers often surprise themselves
        when they discover that running the marathon can be easier than training for
        it.

        one. You are about to shift to two-week cycles to make certain not to push
        too far too fast. The past weekend featured the longest run in the program:
        20 miles. That''s a bit of distance. That''s serious training. You may need
        some extra recovery time. In keeping with the stepback theme of this week,
        do a little bit less than you otherwise might do. This may mean cutting back
        on some of the workouts I''ve prescribed--even taking an extra day of rest--if

      notes: While training for a marathon, it is possible to have subgoals, or a
        series of goals. You may want to run some preliminary races, and run them
        well, as interim contests before the main race that interests you most. First-time
        marathoners probably need a few races under their belts at distances from
        5-K to the half marathon, if only so they can get some hint as to what their
        marathon finishing time might be. Sometimes I select a primary goal (such
        as running a fast marathon), expecting to use it as a stepping stone to a
        greater goal (running a faster marathon). But marathoners need short-term
        goals, other races leading up to the marathon.

      notes: Strength training is important for both conditioning and injury prevention.
        I lift weights and/or use exercise machines regularly in the off-season when
        I am not racing regularly, but I limit strength training during any competitive
        push. It is wise to cut back on your strength training during the marathon
        mileage buildup as miles increase. Light weights and high repetitions seem
        to work best for marathoners. Do not overdo strength training if you want
        success as a marathoner. I recommend next to no lifting the last three to
        six weeks before the race at the time when you are peaking near 20 miles.

      notes: Five miles at your normal pace followed by strength training--and don't
        forget to stretch. There is little doubt that some form of resistance training
        is beneficial to all runners, says exercise physiologist and Olympic champion
        Peter Snell, Ph.D. Weight training is not likely to produce further increases
        in maximum oxygen uptake in runners, but may improve muscle endurance. Nevertheless,
        with the mileage now up there in the stratosphere, consider cutting back somewhat
        on your strength training. Less weight, fewer repetitions will allow you to
        conserve energy and also reduce the risk of an overuse injury.

      notes: Practically every beginning program depends on gradually increasing distance,
        usually weekly up to the day you do your longest run. Nobody has been able
        to come up with a better program, and I doubt anybody ever will. It is the
        old story of Milo (the ancient Greek wrestler) and the bull. You start lifting
        a calf when it is young, and by the time the calf grows into a heavy bull,
        you have the strength to throw people out of the ring in the Olympics.

      notes: 'Track workout: 7 x 800 meters, jogging or walking 2-3 minutes between.
        Continue to run the 800s at about 5-K pace. One way to benefit from your speed
        sessions is to pace yourself so that you finish each workout faster than you
        began. Coach Robert Vaughan of Dallas, Texas suggests that in a workout featuring
        400-meter repeats, run the first 200 meters of each 400 four or five seconds
        slower than the concluding 200 meters. You shift gears in the middle, instructs
        Vaughan. You kick at the end of each rep. You can apply this to 800 repeats
        by running the first 400-600 meters at pace, then shifting gears. Sometimes
        Vaughan has his runners start their kicks 100 meters out--or 300 meters out.
        His runners seem to enjoy the pace changes. It provides an adrenaline rush,
        both in races and in workouts. Their bodies adapt to quick shifts, and they
        learn that they can go fast at the end of a race.'

      notes: Hill training can help you improve both strength and speed. You can run
        sprints up hills as a form of speed training or shift to hilly courses for
        your long runs. Preparing for the Chicago Marathon, which has a relatively
        flat course, I would select flat courses for my long runs. When I prepared
        for a hillier marathon, such as Boston, I trained over hillier courses, at
        least during the closing stages of my training.

      notes: Six miles at marathon pace. Let me suggest a little test for you. Cruise
        the first several miles right on race pace, then run the next mile slightly
        slower. Get back on pace for the next mile, then run the next mile slightly
        faster. Then back to race pace the final mile. During the marathon itself,
        you won't be able to achieve a perfect pace. For instance, walking through
        water stops may slow you in certain miles. You need to learn how to make subtle
        shifts in pace to achieve your time goal. Try also to visualize yourself running
        the last 6 miles of the race. If the marathon you're planning to run is in
        your home town, consider the possibility of running the exact 6 miles you
        will be running on race day. This may take some planning and require recruiting
        a friend to drop you along the course, but this marathon is important to you.

        In order to get full benefit from running three 20-milers within a five-week
        period, you need to cut mileage between. If you want a test race, this might
        be a good weekend for it. A half marathon would fit perfectly into the training
        plan, since today's workout is 12 miles. If you choose this option, skip Saturday's
        planned workout and either rest or jog easily. You also have the leeway to

        week with that hanging over your head. But as an advanced runner, you should
        be able to meet that challenge, which is why I had no hesitation in also prescribing
        a 10-mile pace mile the day before your 20.

      notes: Ten miles. Your most difficult task will remain not going the distance--since
        you can handle this many miles easily now--but rather fitting a run that may
        last 90 minutes or more into your work week. Can you juggle your work schedule
        to allow some time off, perhaps a day's vacation the weeks you do these midweek
        10-milers? The same with your social life. Get some more sleep. You really
        don't need to stay up late to watch that David Letterman rerun, do you?

      notes: Five miles run comfortably. The pace for a comfortable run this day may
        be faster than the comfortable pace you ran a dozen weeks ago when you began
        your marathon training. Or it may not. Everybody reacts differently to training.
        At peak training, fatigue can set in. You may need to remove some of the other
        stresses from your life. For instance, strength training normally is good
        for runners, but not toward the end of a marathon buildup. So save your time
        pumping iron and devote the extra minutes you save to stretching.

      notes: Endurance athletes in particular benefit from fuel-efficient complex
        carbohydrates because of the extra calories they burn each day. You need to
        aim for even more total carbohydrates than those who fail to exercise. You
        can eat (in fact, may need to eat) more total calories without worrying about
        weight gain. The average runner training for a marathon and running 25 to
        30 miles a week probably needs a daily caloric intake near 3,000 to maintain
        muscle glycogen stores. As your mileage climbs beyond that, you need to eat
        more and more food, not less. In all honesty, this is why a lot of runners
        run, and why they train for marathons.

        This is a stroll in the park. But running 10 miles at marathon pace is serious
        business, particularly when it serves as a prelude to tomorrow's 20-miler.
        The cumulative effect of 30 miles stacked back-to-back will get you in shape
        to succeed in the marathon itself a half dozen weeks from now. Is the marathon

        90 seconds or more slower than race pace. Depending on how you feel, you might
        want to consider doing this long run slightly faster: 60 seconds or more slower
        than race pace. Or, finish the workout at a slightly faster pace than you
        began. Do you need to walk a bit to finish this run comfortably? Plan your
        walking breaks and take them early to avoid being forced into them at the
        end of the workout. Walk while taking fluids. That''s good practice for the
        race, since you can take more water if you walk through water stops. Experiment
        also with replacement gels for extra energy. When you finish today''s workout,
        congratulate yourself for all the training it took to get you this far.'

      notes: Novices in most training programs connected with major marathons run
        the same pace in their long runs as they will run in the race. Experienced
        marathoners who continually run long at race pace can get into trouble unless
        they slow down. That is because they are training harder in the middle of
        the week, thus risk both injuries and overtraining. While the law of specificity
        suggests that you need to do some running at race pace to condition your muscles
        to the specific pace you will attempt to hold in the marathon, this is best
        accomplished during pace runs and midweek workouts at shorter distances.

      notes: Five miles. Even though this is a stepback week, the Monday mileage prescription
        does change. It's up a mile from previous Monday workouts. The stepback week
        offers you a break between all the 20-milers. In order to train hard, you
        need to be well rested. How hard you run today probably depends on how you
        feel after the 20-milers run the last several weeks. What you do not want
        to do is get so wrapped up in following this schedule that you overlook what
        your body is telling you. If your body tells you to rest today, this might
        be a good time to listen to your body and not Hal Higdon. Of course, since
        I'm telling you to listen to your body, you'll be obeying us both if you rest.

      notes: One reason for racing at short distances during the marathon build-up
        is to get an idea of your fitness level. Once you obtain an estimate of your
        expected finishing time, you can determine the best means of achieving that
        time. Again, experts differ, and there are various ways to predetermine your
        race pace. The simplest is to run at the same pace, plus or minus a few seconds,
        mile after mile after relentless mile for the full distance. That is the approach
        of the pacing teams, and it works!

      notes: Six miles today. It's often a good idea to select slightly different
        courses for near-mileage workouts done back-to-back. Since it takes less time
        to run 6 miles than the 10-milers last week and next week, maybe you can afford
        to go to a particularly scenic location for today's run. My favorite training
        area is Indiana Dunes State Park, despite having to drive 20-30 minutes to
        get there. I park at Wilson Shelter and do a figure-eight loop on Trails 2,
        9 and 10 to get a 5-mile workout. A single loop gives me 3 miles. If you see
        me running in the park some day--maybe even today--be sure to say hello.

      notes: 'One caveat concerning any pace chart: They are designed under the assumption
        that the course is flat, with zero wind. If the course is hilly or windy,
        you may need to make adjustments. A tailwind will make you run faster, sometimes
        as much as several minutes over the course of 26 miles. On a loop course where
        the wind may hit you from different directions at different times of the race,
        you may need to make mental adjustments at midrace to stay on pace. Temperature
        can also affect your pace. When race temperatures rise or fall much above
        or below your comfort level, you may need to throw your pace table away.'

      notes: Five miles today. Remember that the theme of this week is stepback. Punch
        the cruise control button for this workout. Remember also that stretching
        remains important for marathoners, who risk losing flexibility because of
        their high-mileage training. This is particularly important now that you are
        up at the 20-mile level for your long runs with accompanying high mileage
        for the full week. The best time to stretch is not before you run. Pre-workout
        muscles may be tight; the risk of injury is increased. Instead, stretch during--or
        after--your run, when muscles are warmest.

      notes: 'A frequently asked question to my online bulletin boards is: How many
        miles should you put on your race-day shoes? My general recommendation is
        to buy new shoes three to six weeks before the marathon, so you have time
        to test them and obtain a different pair if the first pair causes problems.
        But I run in lightweight racing flats, whereas most runners prefer the extra
        protection offered by their everyday training shoes. Some first-timer runners
        only own a single pair and need to change if their shoes have too many miles
        on them.'

      notes: Your tempo run today is 45 minutes. This is equal to the time you ran
        three weeks ago. Does it make that much difference whether you run 40, 45
        or even 50 minutes? Probably not. In fact, I usually don't cut tempo runs
        this tight. I select a wooded course that I figure will take me about the
        length of time I have planned for the workout. If I'm five minutes plus-or-minus
        off my planned time, it hardly matters. Ten minutes off, however, and I probably
        should have selected a different course.

      notes: During exercise, the body usually produces more heat than you can get
        rid of by sweating. A marathoner's body temperature gradually rises 3 or 4
        degrees to 102 degrees F, an efficient level for energy utilization. At this
        point, your air-conditioning system is in sync with the environment and you
        perform well. If the weather is too hot or too humid, or you become dehydrated,
        resulting in a drop in sweat production, the body temperature can soar to
        dangerous levels. Your muscles will not perform efficiently at temperatures
        that are too high (104 degrees F and up), so that will slow you down. This
        is an important defense mechanism, because if you fail to sweat and your core
        temperature rises past 108 degrees F, you may suffer heatstroke, a potentially
        serious problem that can cause headaches and dizziness, and in extreme cases
        convulsions, unconsciousness, and death.

      notes: Low-carb diets do not work for runners. The Atkins Diet is a disaster
        for distance runners, as are any weight-loss diets that limit carbohydrate
        intake. Go on one of these fad diets, and you may experience a sudden reduction
        in weight, as measured by your bedroom scale. This weight loss, often dramatic,
        provides an instant boost to the dieter's ego and may cause the individual
        to stay on the diet and continue to lose weight. That's good. But the instant
        loss is artificial, since the shift in the protein/carbohydrate ratio causes
        the body to lose fluids. Dehydration can be a danger for those training for
        a marathon, and particularly in the marathon itself.

      notes: I encourage participants in my training programs to drink during the
        long runs. Not only does drinking fluids make their weekend long runs more
        comfortable, but it teaches them how to drink and how often to drink. It underscores
        the importance of proper fluid replacement. Research also suggests that proper
        fluid replacement can help prevent cramps. No tennis player would start a
        match without practicing lobs; no golfer would think a game complete without
        learning how to pitch from a sand trap.

      notes: If sweat loss is not replaced during exercise, says Robert Murray, Ph.D.,
        a consultant for the Quaker Oats Company, the resulting dehydration compromises
        cardiovascular and thermoregulatory function, increases the risk of heat illness,
        and impairs exercise performance. Dehydration reduces central blood volume.
        This prompts the body to decrease both blood flow and sweating in an attempt
        to conserve body fluids. Under these circumstances, the body's ability to
        cool itself declines, and the body temperature can rise to dangerous levels
        unless you stop running, and it may not decrease even then if you fail to
        get out of the sun.

      notes: In preparing for the marathon at the 1981 World Masters Championships
        in Christchurch, New Zealand, I experimented with walking through aid stations
        at several shorter races and discovered I lost only seven seconds off my time
        if I walked to drink. That is inconsequential. In the race, I walked through
        every aid station (positioned at 5-K intervals) and figured I lost less than
        a minute en route to victory in the M45 age group with a time of 2:29:27.
        Many of the runners I beat that day had posted faster times coming into the
        race, but finished behind me on a warm day. If you lose only seven seconds
        each time you walk through an aid station running at a 5:30 pace. You will
        lose even less running time at a slower pace, such as 10:00 per mile or slower.

        you have been building a solid training base for your marathon run. Depending
        on how you feel, you might want to pick up the pace slightly for a few of
        the middle miles. Try stretching out a bit between Miles 4 and 7, then come
        in at a gentler pace. Learning how to shift gears mid-race is an important
        race strategy, not only for the leaders but for those in the middle of the
        pack.

      notes: Timing your prerace hydration can be tricky. I recommend that runners
        drink as often as possible until two hours before the race, then stop until
        just before they start to move (which can be several minutes after the gun
        sounds in large races). Otherwise they may need to urinate at midrace, an
        obvious inconvenience. In the last five minutes before moving, I start drinking
        again, often downing a 12-ounce soft drink (usually a Coke or a Pepsi) while
        standing on the starting line, knowing it will be absorbed by the body before
        it reaches the kidneys. One advantage of using a soft drink is that they come
        nicely packaged and can usually be easily obtained in vending machines in
        most hotels. At international races, everything else about the experience
        might be different, but you can usually find a Coke or Pepsi. Sipping a soft
        drink on the starting line works for me, but every runner has to experiment
        and come up with a workable drinking routine before practice and before races.

      notes: No running today. Get to bed early tonight. This is important advice
        for two nights before the marathon. Why? Because a lot of runners get very
        nervous the night before, and find it difficult to sleep. And in order to
        make it to the starting line in time, they often have to rise earlier than
        normal. So the night before the night before is the time to stoke up on sleep.
        Get your sleep on Friday as much as on Saturday to make sure you're well rested
        on Sunday.

      notes: Carbohydrates still rule. You need 400 grams of carbohydrates a day if
        you are on a training program such as mine with weekly mileages above 30,
        500 if your weekly mileage rises above 50, 600 if over 70, and so forth. Eating
        such a high-carbohydrate diet allows you to continuously restock your muscles
        with glycogen, the fuel that is as important in training as it is in racing.
        Because of the number of miles you run, you can also afford a somewhat higher
        ratio of simple versus complex carbohydrates in your diet, although some nutritionists
        might argue with me on this point.

        45 seconds or more slower than race pace, at least toward the end of the run.
        But in all honesty, it is not that important for you to run this workout faster
        than the previous 20-milers. There are too many variables, including your
        level of fatigue toward the end of a demanding training schedule. Most important
        is the fact that you were able to run three workouts this length within a
        space of five weeks. Would it have made sense to have increased the length
        of your peak long run to 21, 22 or more miles? Some coaches recommend just
        that, even taking runners beyond marathon distance. I don't necessarily disagree
        with this approach, but since you signed up to follow my program, you'll have
        to peak at 20, not farther. (Remember to practice drinking fluids and ingesting
        gels today, same as you will do in the race.)

      notes: Cross-training in most schedules for runners is not meant to build muscles.
        (You may build the wrong muscles.) Its purpose is more to offer a relaxing
        workout between hard runs to both build and maintain your aerobic capacity.
        Easy swimming, or cycling is sufficient for most cross-training days.

      notes: With the final 20-miler now history, the taper begins. Run 5 miles today,
        the same as the last two weeks, but you'll do less on other days this week.
        The entire purpose of training over the next three weeks is to allow you to
        rest your body after the previous 15 weeks of progressively tougher training.
        This means gradually reducing the training load, thus the term taper. My taper
        philosophy is that you cut mileage to 75% in Week 16, 50% in Week 17 and 25%
        (not including the marathon itself) in Week 18. The numbers don't work out
        exactly--going from about 52 to 36 to 28 to 11--but they're close. Skip training
        today in favor of total rest if you want. Easy swimming is also a good option
        the day after a long run, since it helps to loosen tightened muscles.

      notes: 'While three weeks of tapering can have a positive effect physically,
        it can have a negative effect psychologically. As runners run fewer and fewer
        miles during the final weeks before the marathon, they suddenly find themselves
        with too much time on their hands. Plus they enjoy running and find that it
        relaxes them: either wakes them up in the morning or allows them to put the
        cares of their workday behind them in the evening.'

      notes: Watch what you eat while tapering. If you are running less, you are also
        burning fewer calories. This could mean you gain a pound or so--no big deal,
        unless you also fill in your spare time by making extra trips to the fridge.
        To keep from piling on extra pounds, you could eliminate junk food from your
        regular diet during your taper week. Get rid of the soft drinks and sugar
        sweets that you may have used to boost your calorie intake during regular
        training.

      notes: Tapering not only permits any damaged muscles to heal; it also promotes
        maximum glycogen (the fuel used by working muscles) storage within your leg
        muscles on race day. You do not want to go into the race depleted of glycogen.
        It matters little whether you are an elite runner or a beginner; you still
        need a two- or three-week taper. Research by David L. Costill, Ph.D. of the
        human performance laboratory at Ball State University actually pinpointed
        six weeks as best for tapering, although it was done with high-intensity swimmers,
        not runners.

      notes: Rest day. David L. Costill, Ph.D. studied tapering runners and swimmers
        at Ball State Univrsity's Human Performance Laboratory. He found the main
        problem with tapering runners was that, psychologically, they worried about
        losing conditioning by running less, so became anxious. Also, at least in
        early time trials following a taper, they were so well rested and felt so
        good they ran the first few laps of a 5,000-meter test run too fast and faded
        in the final laps. (They got the message the next time tested and did better.)
        Rest is essential. Believe me when I tell you, you won't lose conditioning
        when you taper. On race day, however, you're going to need to control any
        impulses to run the first few miles too fast.

        training for a marathon who claim that they have no energy, that they have
        to struggle to get through their long runs, particularly as the mileage begins
        to escalate toward the end of their training plans. They not only find themselves
        struggling during workouts, but they are also tired at other times of the
        day. They are not eating enough carbohydrates; they are starved for fuel.
        My advice is to avoid any kind of fad diet.

      notes: Four miles at marathon pace. Have you got it right yet? I hope so, because
        this is the last pace run I will ask you to do. Research suggests that you
        need to continue to train at, or near, race pace on the hard days. Duncan
        MacDougall, Ph.D. of McMaster University also studied tapering. We still don't
        know what the optimal tapering plan is, he finally concluded, but we do know
        that if you're going to be tapering for a week or so, it's important to keep
        the intensity of your workouts fairly high as you cut back drastically on
        your mileage. Dr. MacDougall was working with 10-K runners, who would necessarily
        taper a shorter time, but the message for marathoners remains the same. Reduce
        quantity, but maintain quality.

      notes: 'As your mileage increases, your risk of getting blisters increases too.
        Blisters are caused by friction: some outside object rubbing against the exterior
        of your skin. This causes fluid to form beneath the skin, causing a blister.
        As friction continues, more fluid forms, causing pressure and pain. Eventually,
        the blister may burst, exposing raw skin, causing more pain. Blisters are
        not fun and may force you to stop in the middle of a workout, or in the middle
        of a marathon.'

      notes: With the 20-milers past, the focus shifts to maintaining your endurance
        peak. Run 12 miles today, and resist the urge to pick up the pace in this
        easy run. It's okay to run the last miles somewhat faster, but not the entire
        workout. One of the reasons for these long runs is to get your body used to
        moving for a long period of time, as well as distance. If you cut the time
        length of your workouts short by running too fast, you spoil the effect of
        the taper and don't get full benefit. Marathon running is a psychological,
        as well as physical, game.

        another reason why to taper from Owen Anderson, Ph.D., editor of Running Research
        News: Scientific evidence suggests that temporary training reductions bolster
        leg muscle power, reduce lactic acid production, and carve precious minutes
        off race times. In contrast, hard workouts just before a race can produce
        nagging injuries and deplete leg muscles of their key fuel for running--glycogen.'

        Excessive intake of vitamins is a waste of money and in the case of fat-soluble
        vitamins (A, D, E and K) raises the threat of long-term health problems. Liz
        Applegate, Ph.D. suggests a multivitamin that contains iron and zinc every
        other day as a minimum dosage. Younger women need more iron than post-menopausal
        women, she says, as do men who do not eat meat. A single three-ounce portion
        of lean red meat once a week can do a lot to make vitamin supplementation
        unnecessary.

      notes: 'A half hour for today''s tempo run. It''s okay to push the pace up to
        near 10-K pace (as you normally do for tempo runs), but hold at this pace
        for a much shorter time than usual. In Marathon: The Ultimate Training Guide,
        I discuss the psychological implications of doing less: You may not know what
        to do with the extra time. And you don''t want to give up your long Sunday
        run with friends, even in the last weekend before the marathon. Then there''s
        the problem of diet. If you cut down on the number of miles you run, you''ll
        also need to cut the number of calories you eat if you don''t want to gain
        weight. Oh my! And while many marathoners might believe that rest could benefit
        their performance in this marathon, they''re afraid of the effect of two or
        three weeks'' rest on their overall conditioning.'

      notes: Judy Tillapaugh, R.D., of Fort Wayne, Indiana, believes that although
        runners understand the value of carbo-loading before a marathon, they do not
        give equal attention to day-to-day meal plans. Endurance athletes need to
        continually replace energy stores with a diet high in carbohydrates, low in
        fat, and with enough protein to maintain muscle, says Tillapaugh. Some weight-conscious
        runners do not eat enough. And you need to spread your calories throughout
        the day by snacking, choosing healthy fare such as fruit, graham crackers,
        yogurt, or bagels. If you need 3,500 calories daily, you cannot so easily
        pack them into one or two meals.

      notes: 'Total rest. Don''t stay out too late tonight. You want to catch up on
        any sleep you might have lost during the hard weeks of your training. Sleep
        loss is cumulative, and it''s time to catch up. Here''s some advice on eating
        habits during the taper period from Marathon: The Ultimate Training Guide:
        Watch what you eat. If you''re running less, you''re also burning less calories.
        This could mean you gain a pound or so--no big deal, unless you also fill
        in your spare time by making extra trips to the fridge.... To keep from piling
        on extra pounds, you could eliminate junk food from your diet during your
        taper week(s).'

      notes: You do not need to patronize Italian restaurants to ensure an adequate
        supply of complex carbohydrates. I sometimes choose a Chinese restaurant,
        because rice is also high in carbohydrates. Nancy Clark, R.D., author of Nancy
        Clark's Sports Nutrition Guidebook (among the best books on the subject) points
        out that you can get plenty of carbs in most American restaurants. If you
        eat soup (such as minestrone, bean, rice, or noodle), potatoes, breads, and
        vegetables along with your main dish, and maybe grab a piece of apple cobbler
        off the dessert tray, you can end up eating more carbohydrates than fats or
        protein.

      notes: Pasta has become the ritual prerace feast for marathoners. No major marathon
        is without its night-before spaghetti dinner, which has assumed almost ceremonial
        aspects. The spaghetti dinner, of course, has more than a ceremonial purpose.
        In eating high-carbohydrate pasta, we want to make sure our bodies have adequate
        glycogen, the fuel supply stored in the muscles that allows the most efficient
        form of energy metabolism.

      notes: The more glycogen you can store, the faster you can run for longer periods

      notes: As you do an easy two-miler, remember that the last days are critical
        to the final taper. Some comments on diet, a very important subject this last
        week because of the necessity to stock your muscles with fuel-efficient glycogen.
        Robert Eslick, a coach from Nashville, tells his runners to watch their intake
        for the first three days of the marathon week to avoid weight gain and then
        to eat a little more than their normal intake, with the emphasis on carbohydrates,
        the last three days. Sound advice.

      notes: Research at Ball State University suggests that eating two small meals
        four hours apart the night before the race may be better than eating one larger
        meal. Logistically, that used to be difficult to do, but with so many energy
        drinks and bars on the market, carbo-loading has become easier. Dr. Costill
        recommends that a high-carbohydrate snack just before going to bed may help
        assure a full supply of glycogen in your muscles. Avoid soft drinks with caffeine
        that may keep you awake.

      notes: No more hard training. Today is a day of rest. The last three days are
        critical to the final taper. Usually I rest two days and do some light jogging
        on the third. In this schedule I advise that you rest Thursday and Friday
        with a final easy run on Saturday, the day before the marathon. You can juggle
        these days to suit your own temperament. Carbo-loading begins in earnest today.
        Pasta, rice, potatoes, cereals, fruits. Don't make radical changes in your
        regular diet, but now is not the time for filet mignon. Cut back slightly
        on your intake of calories, since you will be burning fewer calories in this
        final tapering week.

        For international races requiring an overnight jet flight, I need to arrive
        much earlier. For a short overseas track race, I will sometimes arrive a couple
        of days before I compete; for marathons I need nearly a week to adjust. One
        rule of thumb is to arrive one day early for every time zone crossed, if the
        cost of hotel rooms is not prohibitive.

        it could be on any one of those days. Usually, however, I like a final shakedown
        workout the day before. Quoting again from Marathon: The Ultimate Training
        Guide: There''s no longer any room in your training plan for hard, fast, or
        long runs. Forget them. If you run anything at or near race pace, don''t run
        far. (The day before a marathon), I enjoy doing ''strides,'' which are controlled
        sprints at race pace. But by definition, strides are short: 150 meters at
        the most. Soft surfaces are best. Instead of jogging between strides, I''ll

        Even though the second and third helpings are free, do not necessarily avail

        In the past, I noticed a lot of runners walking around expos with water bottles
        in their hands. I see that less often now, suspecting that the drink-until-you-drown
        approach to hydration is past its time. If you feel that is what you need
        to do to ensure that you go to the starting line well hydrated, do it, but
        you may spend most of the last 24 hours before the race going to the bathroom.
